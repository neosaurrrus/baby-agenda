Welcome to Baby Adventures, an app to get and contribute ideas for fun things you can do with your baby. It will also allow you to add 
ideas you like the sound of to plan your day and let folks know if it was any good!

Built with Rails and Javascript.

## Installation
Clone down this repo. Run `bundler install` to grab all the required dependancies. Run `rails db:migrate` to build the relevent databases and `rail s` to run it locally. The index.html file in the front end folder will run the frontend.

**Currently this does not have the enviroment variables configured, so it will require modifying the endpoints found in the index.js folder**

## Usage
The App will allow you to signup as a new user, login and logout. Once you are signed in, you can create a new activity. All users can view all activities but only users can create,edit and delete them as well as add them to thier own list!
